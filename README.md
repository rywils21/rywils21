### Hello ðŸ‘‹

My name's Ryan. I love to build things. Software is the best medium for building things because of how cheap and fast it is to try out different ideas. This profile includes some things I've built that I'm able to share.

I'm a fullstack developer with a preference for the frontend. React apps are incredibly fun to write! I also love doing cool things like using SVG or canvas to make wild interactive apps.
